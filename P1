a)Do newly created child processes, C1 and C2,have their own copies of the different variables declared in the parent process(e.g. index, now, value, outBuffer,outFD)?
	yes they have their own copies of the variabels.
b)
Is there a fixed order of execution between child processes C1 and C2? And how do you 
explain that? 

	No there is no fixed order the order is determined by the OS and we do not know this order

c)Modify the code so C1 will completes printing its output before C2 starts printing its own output. 
	put a wait int the if(C1 == 0) statemtent right before the for loop so this waits for C2 before it prints its own stuff.
